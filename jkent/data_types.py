"""Data types for the scraper-driver architecture.

This module defines the core data types used for communication between
scrapers and drivers. These types are designed to be:

1. Exhaustive - Using Python 3.10's match statement to ensure all cases are handled
2. Serializable - Continuations are strings, not function references
3. Immutable - Dataclasses with frozen=True where appropriate

        Some websites return HTTP 200 status codes but embed error states
        in the page content or headers (e.g., "No results found" pages,
        session timeout pages, soft 404s). This method allows scrapers to
        detect these hidden failures.

        This is primarily used for speculation handling. When a
        speculative request gets a 2xx response, the driver calls this
        method to check if the response actually represents a failure.
        If this returns False, the driver sets the response status_code to
        SPECULATION_SOFT_FAILURE_STATUS (555) before calling the speculation
        callback.

        Args:
            response: The Response object to check for hidden errors.

class Request:
    """Unified request type for all scraper navigation patterns.

    Provides common functionality for URL resolution and HTTP parameters.
    Each request tracks its current_location and request ancestry.

    Controls behavior via boolean flags:
    - Default (nonnavigating=False, archive=False): Navigating request.
      Updates current_location when resolved. Supports speculation.
    - nonnavigating=True: Fetches data without changing current_location.
      Useful for API calls that provide supplementary data.
    - archive=True: Downloads and archives files. Preserves current_location.
      The driver returns an ArchiveResponse whose ``file_url`` holds the
      local filesystem path, injected into steps as ``local_filepath``.

    Attributes:
        request: HTTP request parameters (URL, method, headers, etc.).
        continuation: The method name to call with the Response, or a Callable.
                     When a Callable is provided, the @step decorator will automatically
                     resolve it to the function's name.
        current_location: The URL context for resolving relative URLs.
        parent_request: The immediate parent request that led to this one,
                        or None for entry requests. Only the one parent is
                        kept (not the full chain) to bound per-request
                        memory growth.
        accumulated_data: Data collected across the request chain.
        priority: Priority for request queue ordering (lower = higher
                  priority). None means "unset": the request inherits the
                  target step's priority when its continuation is a
                  Callable, archive requests default to
                  ARCHIVE_DEFAULT_PRIORITY, and the queue falls back to
                  DEFAULT_PRIORITY (see effective_priority). An explicit
                  value — including an explicit 9 — is always kept.
        deduplication_key: Key for deduplication (defaults to hash of URL and
            data). Pass a ``SkipDeduplicationCheck()`` instance to opt out.
        permanent: Persistent data (cookies, headers) that flows through the request chain.
        is_speculative: Whether this request is speculative (probing for content existence).
        speculation_id: Tuple of (function_name, param_index, integer_id) identifying
                       which speculative template generated this request. None for
                       non-speculative requests.
        via: Optional description of how the request was produced (ViaLink, ViaFormSubmit).
             Enables the Playwright driver to replay the browser action. HTTP driver ignores.
        bypass_rate_limit: If True, skip the rate limiter for this request.
             Useful for time-sensitive requests (e.g., file downloads) where
             stale server-side state expires quickly and delays cause failures.
        reseedable: Tri-state marker for whether this request is safe to re-seed in isolation.
             True = stateless; can be re-fetched standalone. False = depends on server-mirrored
             client state (session, ViewState, CSRF token). None = unspecified.
             Consumed by replay tooling to choose how far up the parent chain
             to walk when re-seeding errored subtrees.
        nonnavigating: If True, does not update current_location.
        archive: If True, downloads and archives the file.
        expected_type: Optional file type hint for archive requests ("pdf", "audio", etc.).
        archive_hash_header: Reserved for future use, to contain ETag/SHA256 header ids.
