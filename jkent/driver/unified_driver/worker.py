"""Concrete worker: the per-worker execution loop for a unified-driver run.

It takes its collaborators explicitly: it leases a handle from the
``Transport``, pulls rows from the ``RequestQueue``, gates on the
``RateLimiter``, resolves via the transport, and hands the response to the
``ContinuationExecutor``. Retries/skips/marks go through ``ResponseStorage``;
duration is reported to the monitor and step completions to a ``Compactor``.

Transport recovery is opaque here (see ``worker_contract.md``): a dead resource
arrives as a ``TransientException`` and is retried like any other; the rebuild
happens inside the next ``transport.acquire``.
