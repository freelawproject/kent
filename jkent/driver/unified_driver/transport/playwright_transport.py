"""Playwright transport — engine + per-worker page lifecycle (B1).

Owns browser launch/teardown and per-worker page acquisition. The engine and
browser context are built in ``open`` (wrapping ``engines/``) and torn down in
``aclose``; each worker gets a long-lived :class:`WorkerPage` from ``acquire``,
stable until ``release``.

``resolve`` (B2) handles the navigation path. Crash recovery (B3) implements
the transport-internal :class:`~jkent.driver.unified_driver.lifecycle.Recoverable`
surface (``generation`` / ``should_restart`` / ``restart``): a dead connection
noticed in ``resolve`` poisons the handle and re-maps to ``TransientException``,
and the next ``acquire`` rebuilds the handle, escalating to a single-flight
engine restart when the connection itself is dead. ``resolve_archive`` (B4)
triggers the download via the request's ``via`` (link click / form submit),
stages the file Playwright hands back, and streams it; ``finish_archiving``
deletes the staged file.

Like ``ReplayTransport`` reuses ``SourceIndex``, this reuses the persistent
driver's :class:`SQLManager` for its execution-time DB needs: reading a
parent's cached response to stage a forked tab, and persisting captured
incidental sub-requests against the navigating request's row id.
