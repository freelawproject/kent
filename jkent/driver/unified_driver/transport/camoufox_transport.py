"""Camoufox transport — a Playwright transport over a camoufox engine.

Camoufox is the engine that reliably passes Cloudflare's CAPTCHA, so
``CFCAP_HANDLER`` scrapers run on it. It is a ``PlaywrightTransport`` in every
respect except the engine: a persistent-context Firefox that carries
``cf_clearance`` cookies forward across restarts. Its Firefox process
occasionally crashes on page-error events, surfacing as a ``Connection closed``
channel error — already recognized by the inherited ``should_restart``
predicate, so crash recovery (B3) needs no override. Launch + restart deltas
live in ``CamoufoxEngine``; this transport just selects it.
