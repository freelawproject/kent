"""Replay run: a :class:`ScrapeRun` configured to replay from source DB(s).

Handles the *orchestration* half of replay (the parts that aren't execution):
it swaps in a :class:`ReplayTransport` (index lookups instead of network), a
:class:`ReplayWorker` (miss-policy failure routing), and a
:class:`ReplayStorage` (stub/delete/finalize terminal states), then adds the
two Run-level hooks the replay workflow needs — seeding mode-3 reseedable anchors
into the queue on ``open`` and finalizing stubs on ``aclose``.

The replay does no network I/O, so the run is unrate-limited by default.

Crash semantics: the output DB is only valid once ``aclose`` has run
``finalize_stubs`` to resolve the intermediate ``stubbed`` rows into clean
``pending`` ones (``restore_queue`` does not rescue ``stubbed``). A replay that
dies mid-run leaves those rows stranded, so a crashed replay's output DB is not
recovered — it is discarded and the replay is re-run from scratch against the
source DB(s), which are never mutated.
