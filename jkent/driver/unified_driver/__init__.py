"""Unified driver — a transport-agnostic driver stack.

The driver core owns orchestration (queue, workers, storage, retries); a
:class:`Transport` owns request execution and the lifecycle of whatever
resource that execution needs.

The package holds the role protocols plus the concrete pieces: the
transports, the rate limiter, the orchestration substrate (queue, storage,
continuation executor), and the monitor/compactor.
