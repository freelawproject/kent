"""Speculation support for the unified driver.

:class:`SpeculationManager` holds the per-step :class:`SpeculationState` dict
and implements the two abstract hooks of
:class:`~jkent.driver._speculation_support.AsyncSpeculationSupport` against a
:class:`~jkent.driver.unified_driver.persistence.RequestQueue` (enqueue) and a
:class:`~jkent.driver.database_engine.sql_manager.SQLManager` (persist). The
seed/extend/track engine lives in the shared base; this class only wires
dispatch and persistence.
