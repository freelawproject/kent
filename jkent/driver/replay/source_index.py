"""SQLite-backed index over multiple source DBs for replay.

Maps each fulfillable ``deduplication_key`` to the winning source row,
applying the consolidation policy: most recent ``completed_at_ns`` →
most recent ``created_at_ns`` → lower source-list position.

Inclusion gate: a source row enters the index iff it has a stored response
(``response_status_code IS NOT NULL``). Rows without one (pending,
in_progress, network-failed) are naturally absent and fall through to the
driver's miss policy. An empty-body response is stored with a NULL inline
``content_compressed`` (and archive rows keep their body on disk), so the
gate does not require content — ``fetch_response`` reads a NULL body as
empty bytes.

The ``retry_eligible`` flag is True for source rows that have an
unresolved structural / validation error against them — used by
``curr-error-free`` mode to re-execute the continuation against the
stored response.
