"""reseedable-aware parent-walk used by mode 3 (``desc-error-free``).

For each errored row in a source DB, walk ``parent_request_id`` upward
until the first ancestor with ``reseedable = True``. If none is found,
walk to the root (``parent_request_id IS NULL``). The chosen anchor is
the row that gets re-seeded in the output as a pending entry request.

Every row on that upward path — from the chosen anchor down to the
errored row, inclusive — is *excluded from the source index* so that
when the replay scraper yields them, they fall through to the miss
policy (typically ``stub``) and end up as pending in the output. Only
the rows on the errored-row → anchor chains are excluded; non-errored
sibling/cousin descendants of the anchor stay in the index and are
served from their stored responses (they are re-yielded by the
re-fetched anchor but not themselves re-fetched).
