"""Dev-time-only contract decorators.

A thin gate over :mod:`icontract`. When ``JKENT_ENFORCE_CONTRACTS`` is
unset or ``0`` (any production install), :func:`require` and
:func:`ensure` return the decorated function untouched — no wrapper, no
condition evaluation, and ``icontract`` itself is never imported, so it
can live in the dev dependency group rather than the SDK's runtime
dependencies.

When the variable is set to anything else, the real icontract
decorators are applied and violations raise. The test suite flips it on
for every run (top of ``tests/conftest.py``); CrossHair runs against
production modules need it too::

    JKENT_ENFORCE_CONTRACTS=1 uv run crosshair check \
        --analysis_kind=icontract <module>

The gate is evaluated at decoration (i.e. import) time, so the variable
must be set before any ``jkent`` module is imported.
