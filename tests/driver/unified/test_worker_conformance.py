"""Conformance suite for the ``Worker`` ABC (orchestration.py).

``Worker`` is intentionally thin — ``worker_id: int`` plus ``async def run()``
— with the rich behavior living inside ``run()`` and described in
``worker_contract.md``. Because the contract is collaborator-driven, this suite
drives a fully-wired runnable worker over in-memory fakes (a queue + a
transport) and asserts the *observable* outcomes rather than poking at
internals.

Contract under test (see ``worker_contract.md``):

- Identity: ``worker_id`` is an ``int`` and the worker is a ``Worker`` instance.
- Drain: ``run()`` processes every queued request and returns once the queue is
  idle.
- Transient retry: a request whose first ``resolve`` raises ``TransientException``
  is retried (re-processed) and ultimately completes.
- Halt propagates: a ``RequestFailedHalt`` raised while resolving propagates out
  of ``run()`` and stops the worker.
- Skip continues: a ``RequestFailedSkip`` marks the request failed (not retried)
  and the worker carries on with the rest of the queue.
- Stop signal: setting the stop event causes ``run()`` to exit.

The reference fake worker below implements exactly that documented loop over the
fake collaborators and is exercised through ``TestReferenceWorker`` so the file
runs green; per-item failures are scripted via the fake transport.
