"""Tests for ``CamoufoxTransport`` (B6).

``CamoufoxTransport`` is a one-method subclass of ``PlaywrightTransport``: it
forces the camoufox engine. Everything else (lifecycle, resolve, crash
recovery, archive) is inherited and already proven for the parent in B1–B5, so
this module covers:

  - the engine-selection delta (browser-free): the subclass always builds a
    camoufox engine, where the parent defaults to playwright;
  - that it remains structurally a ``Transport`` and a ``PlaywrightTransport``;
  - that the inherited crash predicate recognizes camoufox's Firefox page-error
    crash (a ``Connection closed`` channel error);
  - the full ``TransportConformance`` over a REAL camoufox, gated on a launch
    probe so it skips cleanly where the camoufox/Firefox binary is absent.

Fidelity strategy mirrors B5: a real headless engine, not a stub. The archive
``resolve_archive`` path is inherited byte-for-byte from ``PlaywrightTransport``
(exercised by B4 + B5), so the two archive conformance methods are skipped here
rather than re-driving a camoufox download.
