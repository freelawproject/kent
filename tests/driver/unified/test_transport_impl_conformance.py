"""Bind the reusable conformance suites to the real ``HttpxTransport``.

The reference fake in ``test_transport_conformance`` proves the suite is
self-consistent; this file proves the suite passes against the actual
``HttpxTransport`` — the Phase 0 "wire the real impls into conformance" step.
(``ReplayTransport`` conformance moved to jent with the replay driver.)

The transport holds no per-worker state, so its ``WorkerHandle`` is a no-op;
the suite's stability/freshness checks pin the get-or-create contract
(``acquire`` is stable per ``worker_id`` until ``release``) that it now honors.

To make ``resolve``/``resolve_archive`` actually resolve under the conformance
methods, the subject is paired with a coordinated backing: a live aiohttp
server answering ``200`` + a non-empty body for any path; ``make_queued``
points at it.

``HttpxTransport`` is also run through ``AsyncLifecycleConformance``. Its
resource-leak test is written against the reference fake, so the subclass
overrides it with a transport-specific "backing is released after aclose" check.
