"""Contract tests for ``Compactor`` (jkent.driver.unified_driver.orchestration).

``Compactor`` tracks one scraper step's response count *in memory* (so it
never queries the DB to decide when to act) and, on the call that reaches the
threshold, owns a one-shot job: train a zstd dictionary for the step from its
stored responses and recompress them.

Contract under test (see ``compactor_contract.md``):

- In-memory counting: each ``record_request()`` before the threshold bumps the
  count and returns ``False`` without touching the database.
- One-shot at threshold: the call that brings the count to ``threshold``
  trains a dictionary and recompresses the step's responses, then returns
  ``True``.
- Owns the work: after that call a compression dictionary exists for the step
  and every stored response for the step is recompressed against it.
- Inert afterwards: later calls return ``False`` and train no second
  dictionary.
- Below threshold: no dictionary is trained.
- Seeding: a Compactor seeded with ``count`` reaches the threshold after the
  remaining calls (resumed runs continue rather than restart).

The in-memory counting is exercised with hypothesis; the train+recompress
behavior against a real in-memory SQLite database with mock responses.
