"""Reusable conformance suite for the ``Run`` protocol.

``Run`` (jkent.driver.unified_driver.orchestration) is the outermost lifecycle:
the owner and supervisor of a single scrape. It composes ``AsyncLifecycle``
(``open``/``aclose``) and owns the transport, the worker registry, the monitor,
the compactors, and the rate limiter. This suite pins only the *observable*
protocol surface, not the full orchestration wiring.

Contract under test (see ``run_contract.md``):

- ABC conformance: the subject is a ``Run`` instance (subclasses the ABC).
- Lifecycle: ``open`` and ``aclose`` are awaitable and bracket usage; the
  transport is brought up in ``open`` and torn down in ``aclose``.
- Transport ownership: ``transport`` is exposed and non-None once open.
- ``status()`` returns one of ``"unstarted" | "in_progress" | "done"`` and
  starts at ``"unstarted"``.
- ``spawn_worker()`` returns an int id, increments ``active_worker_count``, and
  distinct calls return distinct ids.
- ``stop()`` signals a graceful shutdown, observable as ``status()`` reaching
  ``"done"`` after the run drives to completion.

Timing is kept out of the contract: "done" is modeled via the stop flag plus an
empty/exhausted work set, never wall-clock.

Below the suite lives a minimal in-memory reference ``Run`` and
``TestReferenceRun`` so this file runs green on its own.
