"""Concurrency tests for ``PlaywrightTransport`` (T1.1 + T1.2).

T1.1 — worker-page registry invariants: ``acquire``/``release`` keep a 1:1,
get-or-create mapping between worker ids and pages, stable under concurrent
interleaving, fresh after release, rebuilt after a crash. The page-registry
half runs against a real browser; the crash/generation half uses the
browser-free recovery override (single-flight rebuild under the generation).

T1.2 — concurrent DOM-snapshot / incidental isolation: under forced
interleaving, each ``resolve`` snapshots ITS page (no content/url bleed) and
each captured incidental is tagged to ITS ``request_id`` (no cross-contamination
across worker pages).

Browser-gated: skipped cleanly when no engine launches. Every transport opened
here is torn down (yield+finally / try+finally) so no browser process leaks.
