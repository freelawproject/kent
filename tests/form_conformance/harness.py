"""The per-run harness: one event loop, one set of transports, the oracle.

Launching a browser per Hypothesis example is too slow (the repo's other
generative rigs avoid browsers for exactly this reason). So this harness opens
everything *once* — the echo server, an in-process DB, the HTTP transport, the
chromium + camoufox transports, and an independent vanilla-browser oracle — and
reuses them across every example, driven from a single persistent loop via
``loop.run_until_complete`` (the ``test_transport_registry_machine`` pattern,
since Hypothesis does not compose with pytest-asyncio).

:meth:`Harness.run_case` is the heart: it turns one :class:`FormCase` into a
single ``Form.submit(...)`` request (the production path: parse the rendered
HTML with ``find_form``, then ``submit`` with the case's overrides), then drives
that one request through every transport plus the browser oracle and returns
each side's canonical submission for comparison.

Each transport that can't launch in the environment is simply skipped (recorded
in :attr:`available`); if the oracle browser itself can't launch there is no
ground truth and the bound tests skip entirely.
