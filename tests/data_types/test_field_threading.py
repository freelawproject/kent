"""Field-threading regression guard for Request copy methods.

Request.resolve_from() and Request.speculative() rebuild the Request by
listing every field by hand. When a new field is added to Request (or
BaseRequest) and not threaded through those constructors, it silently
resets to its default mid-chain — no error, just lost state.

These tests are driven by dataclasses.fields(Request): adding a field
without registering a non-default test value here fails loudly, and a
copy method that drops the field fails the survival comparison.
